                <p class="text1">This story begins 150 years ago in the majestic Rajasthan Desert where a family legacy was formed in the depths of history. The Bawri family's male heirs were esteemed treasurers to the Maharajas of Patiala. <br>  The family was revered for generations as their flourishing fortunes were intertwined with that of the royal court. </p>

                <p class="text1">Mahendra Singh was crowned the 6th Maharaja of Patiala at the tender age of ten. Therefore the kingdom was run by a council until the Maharaja came of age. <br> Unfortunately, the council perceived Treasurer Bawri's loyalty to the Maharaja as a threat to them. So the council forced him to resign in 1868.</p>

Since there were no commercial opportunities in the desert state he had to contend with fate after his father was forced to resign as treasurer. <br> A chance encounter with a soldier transformed his life. The soldier told him, “Seek your fortunes in Shillong, Assam. I am stationed there, and I will help you”.</p>
